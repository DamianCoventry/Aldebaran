The idea behind the game is to use your spaceship to destroy
all the asteroid pieces.  Once all pieces are destroyed the game
will advance you to the next level.

Periodically enemy spaceships will fly into the level and shoot
spaceship debris and your spaceship.  If you destroy all enemy
spaceships then a pickup will appear which you can collect by
flying into it. Pickups will assist you in your task of destroying
asteroid pieces.

You can shoot the pickup as it moves around the level to change
it to a different pickup.  However be aware that the pickup
doesn't hang around for a long time.
