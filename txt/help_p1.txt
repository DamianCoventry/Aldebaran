The up and down arrow keys move the player
forwards and backwards.  The left and right arrow
keys turn the player left and right. Either control key
shoots and either shift key toggles the shield on and
off.

The mouse may also be used to turn the player left
and right.  The left mouse button shoots and the right
mouse button toggles the shield on and off.
