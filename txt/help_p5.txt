The multi-shot gun fires three normal shots
simaultaneously: one straight ahead, one 30 degrees
to the left and the final one 30 degrees to the right.

The charge up gun requires you to press and hold the
fire button.  The longer you hold it the more charge
you build up.  Releasing the button fires a shot with
the amount of charge you've built up.  The shot will
destroy objects it collides with and keep going
reducing the amount of charge with each collision
until it reaches zero charge or exits the field of play.
