There's three types of pickups: guns, bombs
and bonuses.

All pickups move around the level randomly
and will eventually leave the level.  The
time that they stay in the level will get
shorter as the levels increase.

The gun pickups are colored green, the bomb
pickups are red and the bonus pickups are
blue.
