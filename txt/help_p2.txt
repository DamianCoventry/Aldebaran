Enemy ships periodically appear and will follow
a list of waypoints around the level.  The enemy
ships shoot at spaceship debris and the player
if either enter their field of view.

As the levels progress the list of waypoints that
the enemy spaceships follow will get smaller and
they're shots will get more accurate.
