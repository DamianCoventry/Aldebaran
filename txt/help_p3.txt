There's two types of asteroids: dirt and rock.

The dirt asteroid is the weaker of the two and
appears in all of the earlier levels.

The rock asteroid appears in the later levels
and takes twice as many shots to destroy as the
dirt asteroid.

As the levels progress more asteroids will be
added to the levels and both asteroid types will
take more shots to destroy.
