The scatter bomb fires thirty six shots in a circular
pattern, useful for clearing small debris.

The reduce bomb reduces all asteroids to their
smallest piece.  This saves you having to slowly break
up all asteroids, but does create a lot of debris.  This
pickup will not appear if all active asteroids are
already at their smallest level.
